    \item[Unique Token]\hfill \\
        NetCash~\cite{netcash}.\note[item]{In NetCash the user and central authority agree on a unique token. To transfer value a user sends a token to another user. Receiving users send the token to the exchange, to be swapped for a new spendable token invalidating the original token}
    \item[Blind-signing]\hfill \\
        Chaumian e-Cash\cite{chaum}.\note[item]{Chaumian e-Cash uses blind signatures created by a central service. These signatures can be verified by the central server without knowing who originally requested them.}

\frametitle{The Bitcoin Protocol}
The Bitcoin block chain is a concrete implementation of B-Money\\\note{The Bitcoin protocol and client software provides a concrete implementation of an altered version of the original B-Money proposal.}
But it uses a block chain.\note{In that it uses a block chain instead of a ``synchronous and unjammable anonymous broadcast channel''}
\begin{block}
{Blocks\ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item contain the latest transactions
\item refer to the previous block in the chain by hash value
\item must meet a ``proof-of-work'' requirement\note[item]{This proof of work is calculated by repeatedly hashing blocks until a low enough SHA256 value is discovered}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\note{This means to replace a block in the chain all later blocks must also be recreated, and thus all of their proof of work's need to be recreated. A bit like a `git rebase' except trillions of hashes must be calculated for each block}

\frametitle{De-Anonymization Techniques}
\note{Because all transactions must be broadcast publicly, the Bitcoin client software uses hundreds of different keys as pseudonyms in a wallet.}
Heuristics can be used to contract the ``transaction network'' into a ``user network''.
\begin{description}
\item[Multi-Input Transactions] If a user cannot fulfill the value of a transaction by spending a  single previous output, the client will combine multiple inputs\cite{reid-anon}.
\item[Change Addresses] Because each output must be redeemed in it's entirety transactions of values smaller than the smallest output available to a wallet, the Bitcoin client uses ``change addresses'' so as to retain the remaining value.

Once contracted any address in a group, can be used to identify that whole group.
\note{Unfortunately, by downloading a copy of the transaction data and using some heuristics, it is possible to group keys back into a single wallet}

Under the change address heuristic  $k_{a4}$ and $k_{b3}$ are also contracted into user $a$ and user $b$  respectively. }

    \note{As you can see it is clear that , under these heuristics, the keys in the red square and blue square can be grouped}

\frametitle{Anonymization Techniques}
\begin{description}
\note{Fortunately a few possibilities exist to remain hidden.}
\item[Fully Trusted Mixing]
A mixing service accepts Bitcoin transactions and automatically sends a new transaction to a newly generated Bitcoin address.
\item[ZeroCoin]
Uses a zero knowledge proof (ZKP) that only proves knowledge of: a Zerocoin in the block chain. The actual serial number used to generate it\cite{zerocoin}.
\item[In-Protocol Mixing]
Groups of users cooperate to create transactions that appear to link their wallets.

\note{Describe the bullets}
\end{description}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Anonymization Techniques}
\note{I'm now going to show you how ZeroCoin works, I'm not going to explain the content on these slides \ldots}
\framesubtitle{ZeroCoin 1}
To spend a ZeroCoin (ZC), given all ZCs in the block chain ${C_1, C_2,\dots,C_N}$, prove knowledge of $C_i$ such that:

\begin{equation}
    (C_i = C_1) \vee (C_i=C_2) \vee \dots \vee (C_i=C_N)
\end{equation}

ZC uses a one-way public accumulator with an efficient ZKP that accumulates ${C_1, C_2,\dots,C_N}$ to produce some $A$, such that it's possible to prove knowledge of a witness s.t. $C_i \in inputs(A)$~\cite{one-way-accumulators}.

A Zerocoin $C_{i}$ is created using serial number $S$ in the group $Z(N)$ using a Peterson commitment, equation~\ref{eqn:zq-create}, repeated until $C_i$ is prime.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:zq-create}
C_{i}=g^Sh^r, C_i \in \mathbb(P)
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Anonymization Techniques}
\framesubtitle{ZeroCoin 2}
An accumulator $A$ can be created from the asserted ZCs.  Adding to the accumulator is trivial, $A' = A*u^{C_i}$.

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}\label{eqn:zkp}
        N &= p \cdot q, u \in QR_{N}(u\neq1)\\
        A &= u^{C_1, C_2,\dots,C_N}\\
        w_i &=  u^{C_1, C_2,\cdots C_{i-1}, C_{i+1}, \dots ,C_N}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Where $N$ is the product of two permanently private prime numbers - these primes are generated once, multiplied to derive $N$ then are permanently destroyed.
\note{\ldots because it involves some advanced cryptography, such as Zero Knowledge Proofs and it's out of the scope of this presentation as you'd need to understand group theory and how RSA works.}
