\begin{abstract}
While cryptographic digital currencies have previously been discussed as mathematical curiosities, Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic currency system has provided significant interest and research efforts.  This research paper aims to investigate these recent research efforts, with a particular focus on anonymity and improvements suggested by the research and development communities.  This paper also shows that suggested methods of de-anonymizing users of the Bitcoin network can be thwarted by careful use of the protocol, and proposes a novel automated solution to this problem.
