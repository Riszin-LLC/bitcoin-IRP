\begin{abstract}
While cryptographic digital currencies have previously been discussed as mathematical curiosities, Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic currency system has become the focus of significant interest and research effort.
This paper critically assess bitcoin in the context of other digital currencies and investigates recent developments and discussions within the Bitcoin development community and scientific literature, with a particular focus on anonymity.
This paper also investigates methods used for de-anonymizing or revealing the identity of users of the Bitcoin network and how these methods can be contravened as well as proposing a novel automated solution to the issue of de-anonymizing techniques.
